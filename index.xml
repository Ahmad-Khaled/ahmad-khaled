      <description>This is actually my favorite TED talk, given by Art Benjamin.

      <description>In the year 2020, I became the team manager for the third year and the fourth competition. That year, we had quite a good time in our timeplan, as we were able to design a full electric car with suspension (for the first time) and only weigh 130kg.
The 2020 project was sponsored by Brightskies company along with Shell Eco-Marathon.
I started mastering python and TensorFlow that year. As I had my graduation project in the field of machine learning, I also had a great experience with model based design using Simulink in MATLAB, and you will get to know more below.</description>

      <description>In the year 2019, I had a lot of experience that year—and this season especially—as I was not only the leader this year, but also the driver in two consecutive competitions. The team had the chance to be on track and compete after passing the technical and safety inspections.\
EVER19&amp;rsquo;s car—ART02—was fully designed and manufactured in a total of 6 month. We had 20 member in the team in different majors, mainly electronics and mechanical engineering.</description>

      <description>In Shell Eco-Marathon 2019, the team had an accumulated experience and that made us break one of our own reords by passing the competition&amp;rsquo;s three phases and the technical and safety inspections.
In the prephases of the competition, we made a technical presentation that was awarded a $3,500.
I had the chance to represent my team and my institute in one of the events that was held by Shell Eco-Marathon.</description>
